We had a fantastic picnic last weekend at Lake Eola Park. The weather was perfect â€“ sunny but not too hot. Isaac made his famous pasta salad, and I baked some lemon cookies.

Blu had the *best* time chasing squirrels (don't worry, she never catches them!) and rolling in the grass. It's moments like these that make weekends special.

We even rented one of those swan boats for a little paddle around the lake. Blu wasn't quite sure what to make of it, but she settled down eventually. It was a simple, perfect day. We definitely need to do it more often before the summer heat really kicks in! We took a few photos which we'll put up on the Photos page soon.

blurb: |
  Our engagement was perfect, it started out as a celebration of Amelia because it was her birthday but actually it was a ruse to keep her occupied while Isaac's friends were at Cypress Grove Park setting up with a flower wall Isaac had made and flower petals all over the floor.
  Amelia was taken to a chocolate factory tour, arcade, and other things all building up till the main event. And Amelia said YES!
  We had a casual photoshoot with a friend behind the camera right away and later scheduled a professional engagement photoshoot with our wedding photographer.
  Both sets of photos are included here.
  Enjoy!

    **Step 1: Prepare Filling**
    Heat 2 teaspoons extra-virgin olive oil or avocado oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium heat. Add ½ cup chopped red onion and 1 teaspoon minced garlic; cook, stirring often, until the onion starts to soften, about 2 minutes. Add 1 (15 ounce) can rinsed low-sodium black beans, 1½ cups water, and 1 tablespoon minced chipotle pepper in adobo sauce; bring to a simmer, mashing slightly with the back of a spatula. Stir in 2 cups shredded cooked chicken and 2 cups chopped kale; cook until thickened, 1 to 2 minutes. Remove from heat. Stir in 1 cup reduced-fat sharp Cheddar cheese, 2 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro, ½ teaspoon grated lime zest (if using), 1 tablespoon fresh lime juice, and ½ teaspoon salt.

    **Step 2: Assemble and Freeze Burritos**
    Spread ¾ cup filling on the bottom third of each of the 4 (8 inch) whole-wheat tortillas, then roll tightly, burrito-style. Individually wrap the burritos tightly in foil and place in a sealable plastic bag. Freeze for up to 3 months.

    **Step 3: Reheat Burrito**
    To reheat one frozen burrito, unwrap and transfer to a microwave-safe plate. Cover with a paper towel and microwave on High until heated through, 2 to 3 minutes.

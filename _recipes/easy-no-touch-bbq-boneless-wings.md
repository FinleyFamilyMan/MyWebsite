    **Prep Chicken & Workspace:**
    Using a fork to hold the chicken steady on the cutting board, carefully cut the 1 lb boneless, skinless chicken into 1 to 1.5-inch bite-sized pieces with your knife.
    Place the cut chicken pieces directly into one of your medium-large bowls.
    If using an oven: Preheat your oven to 400°F (200°C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper and lightly spray the parchment paper with cooking spray.
    If using an air fryer: Check your model’s instructions regarding preheating.

    **Prepare Dry Breading Mix:**
    In your second medium-large bowl OR in a large zip-top plastic bag, combine the 1/2 cup all-purpose flour, the 1/4 cup cornstarch, the 1 teaspoon paprika, the 1 teaspoon garlic powder, the 1/2 teaspoon onion powder, the 1/2 teaspoon salt, and the 1/4 teaspoon black pepper.
    Whisk the ingredients together if using a bowl, or seal the bag and shake well to combine thoroughly.
  - |
    **"Wet" Step (Minimal Touch):**
    If you choose to use a binder, pour the 2-3 tablespoons milk or buttermilk OR drizzle the 1 tablespoon olive oil over the chicken pieces in their bowl.
    Using your tongs (or a spoon), toss the chicken pieces until they are lightly and evenly coated with the milk or oil. This creates a slightly tacky surface for the breading to adhere to.
  - |
    **Bread the Chicken (The "Shake" Method - No Hands!):**
    Using your tongs, transfer the lightly moistened chicken pieces from their bowl into the bowl or zip-top bag containing your prepared dry breading mixture.
    If using a bowl for breading: Use the tongs to gently toss and turn the chicken pieces in the flour mixture until all sides are fully coated. You might need to press some pieces into the flour with the back of the tongs for thorough coverage.
    If using a zip-top bag for breading: Seal the bag, ensuring some air is trapped inside. Shake the bag vigorously for about 30-60 seconds, or until all chicken pieces are thoroughly and evenly coated. You can open the bag to check and use tongs to separate any clumps if needed, then reseal and shake again.
  - |
    **Arrange for Cooking:**
    Using your tongs, pick up each breaded chicken piece one by one. Gently shake off any loose, excess flour.
    Arrange the breaded chicken pieces in a single layer on the prepared baking sheet (for oven method) or in the air fryer basket. Ensure there's a little space between each piece to promote even cooking and crisping. Do not overcrowd; cook in batches if necessary.
  - |
    **Cook the Chicken:**
    *Oven Method:* Bake in the preheated oven at 400°F (200°C) for 10 minutes. After 10 minutes, use tongs to carefully flip each chicken piece. Continue to bake for another 10-15 minutes, or until the breading is golden brown and crispy, and the chicken is cooked through (internal temperature reaches 165°F or 74°C).
    *Air Fryer Method:* Cook at 380-400°F (190-200°C) for about 12-15 minutes. Halfway through the cooking time, use tongs to flip the chicken pieces. Continue to cook until golden brown, crispy, and the internal temperature reaches 165°F (74°C). Cooking time may vary based on your air fryer and the size of the chicken pieces.
  - |
    **Sauce the Wings (Still No Hands!):**
    Once the chicken is fully cooked and crispy, use your tongs to transfer the hot chicken pieces into a large clean bowl.
    Pour your desired amount of 1/2 to 3/4 cup BBQ sauce over the cooked chicken.
    Using a clean pair of tongs or a large spoon/spatula, gently toss the chicken pieces in the sauce until they are evenly and generously coated.

    **Serve Immediately:**
    Use tongs to transfer the sauced boneless wings to plates. Serve hot and enjoy!

### Equipment Needed:
* Cutting board
* Sharp knife
* Fork
* Two medium-large bowls OR one bowl and one large zip-top plastic bag
* Tongs (essential!)
* Baking sheet
* Parchment paper (for oven method)
* Air fryer (optional cooking method)
* Large clean bowl (for tossing with sauce)
* Spatula or large spoon (for tossing, optional)

### Chef's Tips:
* **Dry Chicken for Crispier Results:** For an even crispier coating, you can pat the chicken pieces dry with paper towels before the "wet" step. You can still use tongs to handle the chicken during this.
* **Don't Overcrowd:** Whether baking or air frying, cooking in a single layer without pieces touching too much is key to crispy (not steamed) chicken. Cook in batches if your baking sheet or air fryer basket is too small for all the chicken at once.
* **Sauce Last:** Add the BBQ sauce just before serving to keep the breading as crispy as possible.
* **Extra No-Touch Protection:** If you prefer, you can wear food-safe gloves during the initial chicken cutting step for an added layer of protection, even though you'll be using a fork and knife.

Enjoy your homemade boneless wings!
